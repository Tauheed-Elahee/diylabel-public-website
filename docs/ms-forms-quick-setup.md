## üïê Time Estimates

- **Manual creation with shortcuts:** 30-45 minutes
- **Using Power Apps instead:** 20-30 minutes  
- **Using alternative form builder:** 15-20 minutes

The manual approach with copy/paste shortcuts is still much faster than building each field individually, and you'll have complete control over the form structure.

## üÜò If You Get Stuck

1. **Use the CSV as a checklist** - Check off each field as you create it
2. **Create in batches** - Do all text fields first, then all choice fields
3. **Test frequently** - Preview the form as you build to catch issues early

**The CSV template serves as your complete reference guide even without the import feature!**
