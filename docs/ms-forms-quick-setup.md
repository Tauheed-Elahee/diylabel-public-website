## ðŸŽ¯ Import Tips

2. **Save as .xlsx** - Try Excel format instead of CSV
3. **Manual backup** - Use the detailed guide in `ms-forms-integration.md` if import fails

### Common Import Issues:
- **Multiple Choice fields** might import as single choice - easily fixed by changing field type
- **Conditional logic** needs to be added manually after import
- **Field validation** (like email format) needs to be set after import
