## üîê Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public Insert**: Anyone can submit a partnership application
- **Authenticated Read**: Only authenticated users can view applications
- **Authenticated Update**: Only authenticated users can update application status

### Data Validation
- Email format validation
- Duplicate email prevention
- Required field validation
- Enum constraints for business_type, ownership_role, etc.

## üîç Viewing Applications

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. Select **partnership_applications** table
4. View, filter, and export applications

### Option 2: Custom Admin Dashboard
Create a simple admin page to view applications:

```tsx
// Example admin component
const PartnershipApplications = () => {
  const [applications, setApplications] = useState([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch applications from Supabase
    const fetchApplications = async () => {
      const { data } = await supabase
        .from('partnership_applications')
        .select('*')
        .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
      
      setApplications(data || [])
    }
    
    fetchApplications()
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {applications.map(app => (
        <div key={app.id} className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">{app.business_name}</h3>
          <p>{app.contact_name} - {app.email}</p>
          <p>{app.city}, {app.province}</p>
          <span className={`px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm ${
            app.application_status === 'pending' ? 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800' :
            app.application_status === 'approved' ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800' :
            'bg-red-100 text-red-800'
          }`}>
            {app.application_status}
          </span>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## üìß Email Notifications (Future Enhancement)

You can add email notifications by:

1. **Using Supabase Edge Functions** to send emails
2. **Integrating with email services** like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Resend
3. **Setting up webhooks** to external notification systems

Example email notification function:
```sql
-- Database trigger to send email on new application
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_new_partnership_application()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Call edge function to send notification email
  PERFORM net.http_post(
    url := 'https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-partnership-notification',
    headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer ' || current_setting('app.service_role_key') || '"}'::jsonb,
    body := json_build_object(
      'application_id', NEW.id,
      'business_name', NEW.business_name,
      'contact_name', NEW.contact_name,
      'email', NEW.email,
      'city', NEW.city,
      'province', NEW.province
    )::text
  );
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger
CREATE TRIGGER on_partnership_application_created
  AFTER INSERT ON partnership_applications
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_new_partnership_application();
```

## üîÑ Application Workflow

1. **Submission** - Form data saved to `partnership_applications` table
2. **Auto-confirmation** - Success message shown to applicant
3. **Internal notification** - Team notified of new application
4. **Review process** - Admin updates `application_status` and adds `notes`
5. **Follow-up** - Contact applicant based on review outcome

## üìä Reporting & Analytics

Query examples for common reports:

```sql
-- Applications by status
SELECT application_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM partnership_applications 
GROUP BY application_status;

-- Applications by location
SELECT province, city, COUNT(*) 
FROM partnership_applications 
GROUP BY province, city 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Recent applications (last 30 days)
SELECT business_name, contact_name, city, province, created_at
FROM partnership_applications 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Equipment analysis
SELECT unnest(equipment) as equipment_type, COUNT(*)
FROM partnership_applications
WHERE equipment IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY equipment_type
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Review pending applications** weekly
- **Update application status** as you process them
- **Export data** for external CRM systems if needed
- **Monitor for duplicate emails** or suspicious submissions

### Data Cleanup
```sql
-- Remove old rejected applications (optional)
DELETE FROM partnership_applications 
WHERE application_status = 'rejected' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
```

This Supabase-based system gives you complete control over the partnership application process while maintaining all the functionality of the original form.
